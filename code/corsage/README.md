# Code

Code folder for the PCB

Each directory here will contain the CircuitPython code and libraries to run the given program on the badge.

To change the code running on the badge simply connect the Pico via USB to a computer and replace the .py files and /lib files on the mass storage device with the ones provided in the chosen directory.

Note: If you upgrade the CircuitPython version you will need to download the version specific version of the library files to match the version you are running for any external libraries you are calling in your code (like neopixel.mpy).

You can download CircuitPython library files here:
